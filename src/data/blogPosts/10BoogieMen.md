**[Update March 2020. Due to a divergence in the direction of my views and those that are being promulgated on the Rational Rise, I made a decision to terminate the show &#39;Stuff You Can&#39;t Say&#39;. However, most of the formative thoughts conveyed in the following blog remain important to me, and thus I am happy to share them on my own platform in my own way].**

In 2019 I&#39;m hosting my own political show called &#39;Stuff You Can&#39;t Say&#39;. As this show is going to be dedicated to parsing out political, philosophical and economic ideas in the spirit of independent thought, and hosted on the controversial alternative media platform &#39;The Rational Rise&#39;, I feel compelled to alleviate the fears and concerns held by beloved friends and family members who do not understand why I might question the modern &#39;leftist&#39; agenda (for want of a better term). As someone who has so clearly benefited from status quo, I can see how my criticism of it might come across as unnecessarily hostile and lacking in gratitude.

My motivation to speak publicly about my political revolution is not coming from a sense of victimhood. If anything, it is my dislike of the victimhood mentality which motivates me to articulate counter arguments to the intersectional postmodern worldview that subverts individual autonomy and invites us to make assumptions about a person&#39;s vulnerability to victimhood on the basis of immutable traits such as skin colour and gender.

I regularly lose sleep worrying about the consequences of stepping outside of the Overton window of accepted thought. During my morning coffee, when the catastrophising 3am-self is finally dormant, I remind myself that I do not harbour any beliefs that are truly outrageous upon close inspection. The perceived threat, as far as I can tell, is that being mistaken or misinformed will burn bridges that can never be rebuilt. Yet if we can&#39;t converse or articulate our thoughts due to the risk of being mistaken or misinformed, then how exactly is independent thought possible?

I don&#39;t know when or how we let ourselves become convinced that it is dangerous to think. It seems that ours is an era where free speech and free thought are viewed with extreme suspicion. Surely, if thinking is dangerous, then not thinking far more dangerous. If you abdicate your capacity to think, then you are adorning somebody else with the privilege of thinking for you. It has been established that IQ correlates with one&#39;s susceptibility to confirmation bias and one-sided reasoning. Being smart is not the same as being wise. I suspect that I am neither as smart nor as wise as my younger self had hoped. Exposing oneself to a diverse range of information and arguments is essential if we cannot rely on our own intelligence, or the intelligence of the people we deem &#39;smart&#39;, to generate wisdom.

Many people who abandon their political home territory of &#39;leftism&#39; (for want of a better term) are immediately denigrated as heartless, low-information bigots. Often because they are maligned for holding positions that they do not in fact hold. These imagined positions are like boogie men. They create an illusion of danger which discourages genuine conversation and goodwill where it is most needed.

The following qualifiers will not apply to everyone who considers themselves &#39;right of centre&#39; or &#39;anti-leftist&#39;, but they do apply to me and I am eager to express them to anyone who is concerned that I have been captivated by an illusion, or swept up by some conspiracy. Allow me to plead innocent. My current positions are held in earnest recognition of what seems to be good information and evidence. Nevertheless, I acknowledge that I am definitely wrong or mistaken about some things (as are we all), and I am willing to update and revise my positions based on new information.

**BOOGIE MAN 1**

**&quot;The left is the party of compassion. Therefore anti-leftism = anti-compassion&quot;**

Reality: I am disassociating myself from the left because I endorse individual sovereignty and personal freedom. Freedom in the sense of &#39;freedom from coercion&#39; not &#39;freedom with other people&#39;s money.&#39; I am highly skeptical of collectivist world views that presume we can know anything meaningful about a person based on skin colour, gender, or sexuality. This presumption fuels the intersectional identity politics of modern leftism as well as the racial and gender superiority narratives of the far right. Therefore, I cannot subscribe to the &#39;leftism&#39; of today, the same reason that most of us cannot subscribe to far-right fascism.

I believe that respect for the individual, rather than their identity group, is a genuinely compassionate vision for humanity.

The Marxist ideal &#39;from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs&#39; is often heralded as a supremely compassionate vision, though demonstrably impractical. Conversely, the libertarian/free-market ideal is sometimes described as &#39;scarce resources flowing to their most valued uses&#39;. If we consider human capital as one of these scarce resources, and &#39;valued uses&#39; as a function of &#39;need&#39;, then perhaps the Marxist and Libertarian ideals are less contradictory than they seem upon initial inspection. It seems to me that the difference between the two philosophies largely rests on the role of the state, which brings me to my next point.

**BOOGIE MAN 2**

**&quot;Not wanting the government involved in x = not caring about x&quot;**

Reality: I am skeptical of government intervention because I don&#39;t believe that history speaks highly of concentrated power. It seems to me that when governments attempt to legislate away self-interest for the &#39;common good&#39;, they instead end up concentrating power in the hands of those with the most persuasive rhetoric who do not have to contend with the often disastrous longterm consequences of their policies.

I believe that the free enterprise system is a stunningly effective mechanism that has been wilfully disrupted by the powerful elite. Too often, the ruling class are happy to curtail the individual freedom of members of their constituencies for the sake of servicing their own will to power. I believe that the evidence establishes that if left uncorrupted, the free enterprise system distributes resources and opportunities in ways that make everyone better off. This is partly because the free enterprise system demands that the pursuit of self-interest be accompanied by the creation of value for other people. Competition is a protective mechanism, not an exploitative one. The worker is protected from exploitation if there are other employers they can work for, the employer is protected from exploitation if there are other people they can employ, and the consumer is protected from exploitation if there are alternative goods and services that they can purchase. Governments rarely distribute resources and opportunities as efficiently and fairly as the free enterprise system can. There are SOME exceptions, which is why I am not a free market absolutist or an anarchist.

**BOOGIE MAN 3 &quot;Loving the free-enterprise system = free-market absolutism&quot;**

Reality: I believe there are roles that the government must play to ensure that the free-enterprise system thrives. The government must consistently and transparently define and protect property rights. The government may sometimes need to intervene in the case of externalities that are not being addressed by the consenting parties of a voluntary transaction. The government must protect the individuals from coercive violence or extortion.

**BOOGIE MAN 4 &quot;Anti-leftism = anti-environmentalism&quot;**

Reality: Given what seems to be a scientific consensus, I don&#39;t see any good reason to doubt the possibility of impending environmental disaster. I am desperately hoping that human ingenuity, innovation and humility will resolve this crisis for future generations. I am, as always, skeptical that every proposed government intervention will be effective, though I recognise that some government intervention is probably necessary to prevent doomsday. Environmental concerns often fall into the category of externalities that I identified above as areas where the government may need to intervene.

**BOOGIE MAN 5 &quot;anti-leftism = anti-equality&#39;**

Reality: I believe in equality of opportunity, not equality of outcome. It is not possible to have both, because if you equalise opportunities you will get unequal outcomes, and if you demand equal outcomes you will have to sacrifice equality of opportunity to get them. This is not philosophical conjecture. This is born out by scientific literature, (though the details of that subject are too dense to explore here). If the &#39;cosmic injustice&#39; of unequal outcomes cannot be rectified through maximising equality of opportunity, then you have no business demanding equal outcomes.

I accept unequal outcomes between groups NOT because I believe that one group of people deserves more resources and opportunities than another, but because:

A) I do not judge groups by one metric of success, and

B ) I do not judge individuals by their group averages.

Men in the West may out-earn women by income standards, but they also die earlier, commit more suicide, and find themselves incarcerated or at the bottom of the socioeconomic ladder far more often than women. Nevertheless, I would not assume anything about an individual on the basis of the relative over or underperformance of any of their myriad identity groups. The low-resolution reality of population averages does not compromise my commitment to treat all individuals with decency and respect.

**BOOGIE MAN 6 &quot;anti-leftism = anti-feminism&quot;**

Reality: I support feminists who address real issues with honesty and goodwill. There are many places in the world today where women are actually treated as second class citizens. This is where the feminist effort is required. But all too often, the feminists of the western world ignore the plights of those women, or worse still, demean and denigrate women who speak out about disgusting practices such as FGM and honour killings. The demonisation of Ayaan Hirsi Ali by women who call themselves feminists is the best example of this duplicitous hostility. Simultaneously, many 21st century Western feminists are engaged in a cynical destruction of their own culture, which has afforded them more freedom and opportunities than any other culture in the world. The modern feminist movement regularly indulges strategies such as

A) spreading misinformation about the wage gap

B ) attributing every instance of low female representation to systemic oppression or sexism against women, without acknowledging the role of free choices made BY WOMEN

C) maligning men for misdemeanours without demanding that accusers provide evidence

D) supporting policies that perpetuate the myth of &#39;toxic masculinity&#39;

E) ignoring every metric by which men have the worse deal, or brushing it off with the nonsensical explanation &quot;the patriarchy hurts men too&quot;

F) demanding complete sexual liberation for women, while imposing strict consent codes that vilify male sexuality and ruin romance for everyone.

G) completely denying the unique and important role that women have to play as mothers, instead arguing that men, or the state, or society at large, ought to absorb more of the economic sacrifices that come along with child-rearing. Many women laud their children as the greatest source of meaning and satisfaction in their lives, and yet in the name of &#39;feminism&#39;, the unique sacrifices of motherhood are regularly characterised as an unfair burden borne by women.

I don&#39;t believe that equality of opportunity between the sexes will result in equality of outcome, so I&#39;ll never endorse a type of feminism that demands a 50:50 ratio of men:women in all industries, organisations, institutions or income brackets. Women will be overrepresented in some areas and underrepresented in others, and that is okay with me if it is the consequence of freedom and not coercion.

I am a certain type of feminist because I believe that everyone is better off as a result of women&#39;s liberation. I love women, and I think we ought to celebrate the vital role that women play in our society. But by and large, I don&#39;t really want to judge individuals by their identity groups, and that includes making assumptions about their aptitude for predation or their vulnerability to victimhood on the basis of gender alone.

**BOOGIE MAN 7 &quot;anyone who accepts unequal outcomes is racist or sexist, by definition.&quot;**

Reality: I understand the difference between population level statistics and individuals. Individuals do not conform to population averages. You cannot know anything meaningful about someone based on immutable traits such as gender, race or sexuality.

Take height for example. Men are taller than women on average. We shouldn&#39;t be surprised if the tallest people in society are predominantly men, and vice versa. And yet, there is significant overlap. The variation within each group is greater than the variation between them, so there are plenty of tall women and plenty of short men. It is impossible to accurately estimate someone&#39;s height based on their gender alone. That doesn&#39;t change the fact that at the far ends of the spectrum, we will see an overrepresentation of one gender.

The same is true of personality and interest differences between men and women, and just about every other case of overlapping bell curves that frightens us.

Assuming that you know something meaningful about an individual on basis of their immutable traits is an offence committed by both collectivists on the left (hello intersectional theorists, who think that immutable traits are an accurate metric for discerning the advantage and disadvantage experienced by individuals) and collectivists on the right (hello fascists, who believe that immutable traits are an accurate metric for discerning the ability or character of individuals).

Population statistics can go a long way to explaining population phenomena, such as the wage gap. They cannot tell us anything meaningful about the specific conditions of any individual&#39;s life. The difference between groups and individuals is a concept that is evaded by the worst representatives of both the right and the left.

**BOOGIE MAN 8 &quot;Atheists must be leftists&quot;**

Reality: I am still an atheist. As far as I can tell, I don&#39;t harbour any views that come from an allegiance to ideology, or belief in the revelation contained within some book.

For example, my socially liberal attitudes to gay marriage remain fully intact. Similarly, I remain pro-choice, though I wouldn&#39;t want an abortion and I wouldn&#39;t recommend it to anyone.

But as my believe in personal freedom has matured, my urge to reason people out of their religious beliefs has greatly diminished.

I have come to respect many Christian values. I think the family unit is fundamentally a good thing for society. I think marriage is an institution that deserves respect and reverence (though of course I do NOT want to see LGBTQ people excluded from it). Original sin is no longer a ridiculous concept to me. Acknowledging the capacity for malevolence that lies within all of us is no joke. I believe that it is a good thing to treat every individual as IF they are a creation of &#39;god&#39; with inherent worth, even though I don&#39;t claim that this a literal truth. I believe that the possibility of forgiveness and redemption can be the difference between life and death for someone on the brink of self-destruction. I also believe that Christians treat sex with a healthy amount of trepidation and respect, and the secular left&#39;s failure to do likewise has led to a dysfunctional hysteria about consent and boundaries that is threatening to ruin romance and eroticism altogether.

**BOOGIE MAN 9 &quot;anti-leftism = nationalism&quot;**

Reality: In principle, I actually believe in open borders, free immigration and free trade in the purest sense. I am skeptical of collectivism, and that includes the collectivism that sees one nation or one racial group as entitled to opportunities by birth right alone. Similarly in principle, I would only endorse open borders on the condition that there were no compromises to the incentive structure that directs resources - including human capital - to their most valued uses. The incentive structures offered by free trade and free enterprises make everyone - employer, employee and consumer - better off. This incentive structure, which is true equality of opportunity, accounts for the unparalleled period of immigration and economic growth in the USA during the 19th and early 20th centuries. In contrast, the modern welfare state of the US today compromises this incentive structure and makes it politically expedient for governments to import immigrants and make them dependent upon the state for the sake of garnering future votes. The same process is paralleled elsewhere in the world and in some cases, the political expediency is felt by existing constituencies as a betrayal. We have this dilemma to thank, in part, for the current immigration crisis in Europe.

As we don&#39;t live in a Libertarian Utopia, I believe that tax payers have a right to demand that immigration be limited to the extent where it does not put untenable stress on existing systems and infrastructure that are paid for by tax payers. Sadly, this is a nod towards the collectivism that I distrust so deeply. But we can not live in absolutes. In any case, to acknowledge the practical necessity of borders is not an indication of belief that people born in one place are superior to those born elsewhere **.**

**BOOGIE MAN 10 &quot;All anti-leftists completely renounce state-funded education&quot;**

Reality: I am a beneficiary and an ongoing participant in the government-funded education system. As a Libertarian who respects the free enterprise system, I don&#39;t shy away from my own hypocrisy here, as I am still completing an esoteric PhD which is tax payer subsidised, and which no consenting participant or group of participants in the free market would be paying me to do. I am very lucky that the system has served me in this way and I am doing what I can to make the best use of this time, so that I can repay my debt to society at large by being productive and useful in the future.

I understand the intuition that accessible and affordable education is a net good for society. I am agnostic about whether education would be best left to the free market entirely, though I do think that the current school system in Australia and many other western economies shields young people from the harsh realities of supply and demand, sometimes indefinitely, if they end up working in the public education sector. As a result of this, I believe every participant in the economy gets a worse deal: employers, employees and consumers alike, because of a less efficient distribution of resources (including human capital), and because in the process of funding education for the &#39;common good&#39;, hard-earned tax dollars are siphoned away to line the pockets of bureaucrats who claim to know what&#39;s best for everyone. Though Australia is, by global standards, a very wealthy nation with a booming economy, we are not immune to wasting our resources and we ought to consider that the cost of doing anything is all the things that could have been done if the required resources were directed elsewhere. This is as true of the choices we make regarding our education as it is of our decision to give up $4 in exchange for a flat-white.

The fact that primary, secondary and tertiary education in Australia is government-subsidised, further compromises the effective distribution of human capital. As the individuals who receive the education do not have to pay its true cost, they often do not consider the value of their education until years later, when in hindsight, they realise that the millennial mantra handed down by our boomer parents &quot;follow your bliss&quot; does not always get you some place worth going. If the true cost of education was felt by those who receive it, then perhaps human ingenuity and creativity would flow to it&#39;s most valued uses, which would make those exercising their ingenuity and creativity much happier in the process of improving living conditions for society at large. Once again, in Libertarianism/reverence for the free market, I can&#39;t help feeling that there is something strangely reminiscent of the Marxist phrase &quot;from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs.&quot;

Regardless of whether education is subsidised by the government or not, I believe that educational institutions will benefit from a broader diversity of thought among educators. I would like to see more libertarians and conservative thinkers balancing out the leftist bias of most state-funded tertiary institutions. If nothing else, this will at least challenge the students in ways that they are not currently being challenged, and develop their capacity to understand views that do not necessarily align with their own.

**TO CONCLUDE**

If nothing else, I hope this piece establishes that I have reasons to believe what I currently believe. Nevertheless, I fully concede that I am bound to be mistaken or misinformed in some ways. Though I am embarking upon a journey of publicly disagreeing with many views cherished by people that I love, I aspire to lose as few friends as possible in the process. I remain committed to updating and revising my worldview on the basis of information and experience and hope that others are open to doing the same.
