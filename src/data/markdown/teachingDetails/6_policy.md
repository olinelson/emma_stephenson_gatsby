title: "Teaching policy"
order: 6

The policy below is designed to provide students with some flexibility while still protecting me from losses that come with cancellations, reschedules, and extra administration work.

If the student wishes to continue lessons with me after their trial, then I will send an invoice requesting payment for 10 lessons in advance. 

Assuming that the lessons are 45 minutes long, the payment due will be $70 x 10 = $700. 

Upon receipt of upfront payments, I will reserve for the student an agreed weekly time for a 12 week commitment period. That allows the student up to 2 lesson cancellations due to illnesses, emergencies, holidays, special events etc, without losing the money paid for those lessons. There is no notice required for these cancellations, as the weekly reserved time has been paid for in advance. The $700 payment secures your weekly time for the duration of 12 weeks until 10 lessons are completed.

After each lesson, I will send confirmation in writing of the number of lessons remaining and the date of the 12 week commitment period deadline. 

I will not provide make up lessons, reschedules or refunds for lessons missed by the student. If the 10 lessons are not completed within the 12 week window, I will not refund remaining lessons. 

If I myself need to cancel lessons for any reason, I will extend the deadline for the commitment period accordingly. For example, if I need to cancel one week of lessons, the new deadline will be 13 weeks after the first lesson rather than 12 weeks.  

If I need to cancel more than 3 consecutive weeks of lessons for any reason, I will refund any remaining lessons and offer a fresh start if/when I begin teaching again. 

Once 10 lessons are completed, the student/parent may purchase another 10 lessons with a new commitment period of 12 weeks.
