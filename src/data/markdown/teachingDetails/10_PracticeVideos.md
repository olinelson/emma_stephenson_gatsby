title: "Practice videos"
order: 10

After each lesson, I will make a short video revising what we did in our lesson and providing guidance for what to practise between lessons. This video will be sent to the student within 24 hrs of the lesson. For younger students I will set the video out so that the student can practise along with the video, ideally without the need for parental supervision.
