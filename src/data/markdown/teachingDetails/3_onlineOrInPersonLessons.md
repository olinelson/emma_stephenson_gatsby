I am now taking in-person students at my home in Thornleigh NSW, while continuing to offer online lessons to students who prefer to take lessons from the comfort of their own homes. During the pandemic restrictions I developed some systems for online teaching that I have found to work really well for my students. For students over the age of 7, I find that online lessons are generally equally as effective as in-person lessons, and often much more convenient. For younger students, it depends a lot on the childâ€™s personality and the setup at home, but often the in-person interaction is crucial for maintaining engagement and effective communication.
