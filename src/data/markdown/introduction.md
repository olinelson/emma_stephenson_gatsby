Thanks for considering me as you or your child’s piano teacher. If we work together, I promise to attend to you or your child’s musical development with compassion, joy and patience. As my previous six day teaching schedule in New York City would suggest, I truly love to teach and have a bounty of experience with students of all ages, levels and interests to draw upon.
