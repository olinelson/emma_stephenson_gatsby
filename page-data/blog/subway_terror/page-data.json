The source: atypical circumstances. An unfortunate combination of sounds and smells, unusual disruptions punctuating an extremely familiar routine, the buzz of city life no longer a consistent hum but the coarse sound of a throat clearing in preparation for the delivery of bad news. </p>\n<p>And during those brief moments of silence between the guttural grunts of our figurative anchorman, in a stationary subway car beneath the streets of West Harlem, wisps of radioactive fiction leaked from the imaginations of eighty strangers in crisis, contributing to an invisible fog far more toxic than the thin pungent smog from the fire in the tunnel ahead of us. </p>\n<p>In New York, there nothing unusual about a stationary train. There is nothing unusual about loud noises that the paranoid might mistake for gunfire or explosions. When out and about, the smell of something burning is just a motivation to walk even faster. Public exhibitions of mental distress are expected. It is normal to find yourself cursing systems and infrastructure, the vital organs of the city heaving and groaning like those of an old man drinking and smoking himself to death. Subway commuters frequently glance up at the ceiling, their mouths miming expletives at the train conductor, as if he were an omnipotent phantom floating in the ether of every carriage. They demand explanations from the conductor the way that they would demand explanations from God himself, were they so bold.\nDisruption, inconvenience and variability are expected. A certain amount of abnormality is, well, normal. Every New Yorker will tell you that. </p>\n<p>But today, a suspicious confluence of multiple normal abnormalities was enough to animate a panic machine in that godforsaken underground box, insulated from sunlight and information, going nowhere. Each of us an appendage of a certain type. My category: the Guardian Angels. Proactively calm oneself by overzealously attending to other’s emotional well-being. Convince oneself that everything is hunky dory by telling others it is so. That was our program, launched from some primitive instinct in the deep folds of our monkey brain.\nOthers were possessed by an urge to make a scene, demand that doors were opened, that people got moving, that something ought be done, that matters be taken into our own hands. People in that category - the Activists - were the nemesis of us Guardian Angels. “Fuck off, you’re ruining my act,” we thought. </p>\n<p>Then there were those who had got on the train already toeing some sharp precipice looking down at something dark and stormy. The extraordinary circumstances of our predicament induced in them an involuntary premature grief, the inevitable tragic conclusion of their trajectory suddenly expedited but not unexpected. These were the Silent Refugees. Humble and private in their suffering, some with wet cheeks, some desperately distracting themselves on smartphones, the blue light bouncing off their anguished faces. The Guardian Angels clung like parasites to the Silent Refugees in an asymmetrical fulfillment of emotional needs. </p>\n<p>Finally, there were the genuinely calm. I call them the Lucky Bastards, born with a baseline mental wellness that makes half the population -especially most women under forty - appear entirely insane. Those people who wouldn’t a fear flame until it was licking their feet. Not necessarily brave, but always lacking the imagination necessary for true cowardice. Us Guardian Angels, we were trying to mimic the exterior of the Lucky Bastards, but sadly we have more imagination and thus, more fear.\nWe overcompensated. </p>\n<p>I found out that the guy next to me was a therapist, meaning in my mind that he was better than most at maintaining an outward appearance of composure while being on the receiving end of bad news. “Life is unpredictable, we just don’t know what will happen” he said - an alarmingly theological observation that my internal profundity fairy plucked from an otherwise practical and rational paragraph about this probably being “just an electrical fire” and the “power of herd mentality to stoke unnecessary panic.” </p>\n<p>The explosive sounds in the distance. The accompanying shakes of the train. The encroaching smoke. The smell of burning plastic. The the conductor announcing “this is an emergency, please let the driver get past so he can get to the northern carriage” with no further information. The Activists behaving like they’d seen this all before and they knew the worst was coming unless we did what they told us. “Let’s go” they ordered, “open the goddamn doors!” The invisible fog, the visible smog, my heart pounding in my throat despite my devoted breath-lengthening exercises. I heard the therapist advising breath-lengthening exercises to my neighbors and indulged the thought that the professional feelings guy had noticed and approved of my coping strategies. </p>\n<p>The driver finally waded his way to the northern carriage. We tried to move once, the train stalled. Power out.\nJilted at the altar.\nTen more minutes in the lukewarm smog. Overheating, the girl next to me removed her winter coat.\n“Thank god this didn’t happen in summer” I said, not fooling anyone with my casual weather-centric conversation.\nThe smog slowly thinned. The sky god conductor announced: “the smoke situation is resolved”. Not jilted after all.\nA train passed in our direction, its passengers seemingly oblivious to our plight. “Fuck you” I yelled, with my middle finger dancing across the window. Everyone laughed, I celebrated the small victory.\nThe train creaked into motion. As we crawled through 103rd st station we glimpsed the debris left behind - a smouldering black pile of junk on a deserted platform. I looked for body parts. I saw only charred paper and an old trolley. I tried to reconcile my feelings of having narrowly escaped death with the pathetic, unimpressive residue in front of me. I felt ashamed that my sense of relief was tainted by exasperation. </p>\n<p>At 4:30pm, I googled the damn thing. I found only one article, which presented the wholly underwhelming facts. No casualties. No injuries. Just atypical circumstances, an underprepared train conductor, and the fickle human mind.\nHuman beings are the only species able to project a million potential futures onto the cinema screen inside our skulls. Why do we possess such a strange and destructive superpower?\nFor those of us on that train, those thirty minutes are forever saturated in cosmic significance. To the rest of the city, the whole event is just another normal, and totally unmemorable abnormality.\nI don’t know what it says about me that I immediately wanted to tell everyone what had happened to me, or rather, to us. Something about the anonymity of a big city makes you feel isolated and unseen even when rubbing up against strangers on a packed subway carriage. That is, until you are entertaining the possibility that you are sharing your last moments in this world together. Then, suddenly, people notice one another. Funny that.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"December 13, 2019","path":"/blog/subway_terror","title":"Subway Terror","featureImage":"images/teaching6.jpg"}},"featureImageQuery":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.0695187165775402,"src":"/static/e193b170ae377382a2e04b98aedbe90d/14b42/teaching6.jpg","srcSet":"/static/e193b170ae377382a2e04b98aedbe90d/f836f/teaching6.jpg 200w,\n/static/e193b170ae377382a2e04b98aedbe90d/2244e/teaching6.jpg 400w,\n/static/e193b170ae377382a2e04b98aedbe90d/14b42/teaching6.jpg 800w,\n/static/e193b170ae377382a2e04b98aedbe90d/47498/teaching6.jpg 1200w,\n/static/e193b170ae377382a2e04b98aedbe90d/cfc08/teaching6.jpg 1309w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}}},"pageContext":{"featureImage":"images/teaching6.jpg"}}}
