Thanks for connecting me with memorable souls. Thanks for squeezing 15 new original songs and another album out of me. Thanks for teaching me to be a piano bar entertainer. Thanks for quadrupling my covers song list. Thanks for offering me a piano teacher who freed me of tension and pain in my playing, and for incubating my new approach to improvising. Thanks for giving me reason to find 8 extra notes in my vocal range. Thanks for the 40 amazing students and for awakening my love of teaching. Thanks for opening my eyes to how unusual it is to be born into prosperous times of peace.\nThanks for confronting me with harsh truths about political ideologies and economic systems, and for absorbing my subsequent philosophical paroxysms...Thanks for checking my ego and gently teaching me to be humble. Thanks for challenging me to research and overcome health problems. Thanks for strengthening my relationship with Oli, and for the city hall marriage ceremony. Thanks for helping me to act according to my own convictions rather than chasing the approval of other people. And most of all, thanks for giving me the courage to leave you, to let go, and to start the next chapter.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"March 01, 2020","path":"/blog/so_long_new_york","title":"So long New York","featureImage":"images/teaching6.jpg"}},"featureImageQuery":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.0695187165775402,"src":"/static/e193b170ae377382a2e04b98aedbe90d/14b42/teaching6.jpg","srcSet":"/static/e193b170ae377382a2e04b98aedbe90d/f836f/teaching6.jpg 200w,\n/static/e193b170ae377382a2e04b98aedbe90d/2244e/teaching6.jpg 400w,\n/static/e193b170ae377382a2e04b98aedbe90d/14b42/teaching6.jpg 800w,\n/static/e193b170ae377382a2e04b98aedbe90d/47498/teaching6.jpg 1200w,\n/static/e193b170ae377382a2e04b98aedbe90d/cfc08/teaching6.jpg 1309w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}}},"pageContext":{"featureImage":"images/teaching6.jpg"}}}
